	<h1>Single Review: “Closer” by The Chainsmokers feat. Halsey</h1>
	<p>By: Joseph R. Atilano</p>

	<p>The Chainsmokers, consisting of Andrew Taggart and Alex Pall, are hands down the most successful EDM act today. The duo have quickly established themselves to be in that position since 2015 when their single “Roses” became a global hit. They were able to continue their winning ways by releasing a few more songs that became certified hit singles proving that Andrew Taggart and Alex Pall are not a flash in the pan–certainly, no “one-hit wonder,” they are. In truth, they are more in the category of being called hit-makers with a growing resume to back that up.</p>
	
	<p>The successful run The Chainsmokers have had for a few years now is largely credited to the fact that they were able to adapt to the times with their smooth transition–from making club banger songs when they first known as crowd favorites and a very popular act in the club circuit to making more radio friendly and commercial songs everyone can enjoy.</p>
	
	<p>However, it was their single “Closer” that has really turned a lot of heads and made people want to discover more of their music–both of the older material and the new ones. The Chainsmokers’ “Closer” marks the very first time that the duo have had a single reach the Number 1 position in the Billboard Hot 100. It is also one of the most streamed songs of this year. Likewise, it continues to have one of the highest digital sales even as the year 2016 nearly comes to a close.The song is proving to have staying power and people are not getting tired of it yet as “Closer” is still on rotation on the radio and music channels.</p>
	
	<h2>What is the overall meaning of ‘Closer?’</h2>
	
	<p>Trying to reconcile with an “old flame” hoping to see if there are any remnants of magic left between the two of them. Here, Andrew Taggart does a decent job in narrating loosely in the third person perspective how his previous relationship with his girlfriend went sour; the possible causes of the break up; and what lessons he has learned from the experience. Guest artist Halsey plays the perfect complementary role of the “ex gf” in the song.</p>
	
	<p>The lyrics leave little to the imagination of the listeners which is a good thing because “Closer” tells a complete story even including the most personal of details. Throw in a dash of dry humor in the lyrics and a Blink-182 reference–and you have a song that does not make the artist appear like he takes himself too seriously either despite its subject matter. More listeners nowadays like that in an artist.</p>
	
	<h2>What is the production value of ‘Closer?’</h2>
	
	<p>First of all, deciphering and analyzing an EDM track is one of the hardest things to do unless you are a DJ, a member of a production outfit, or work or have worked in a recording studio, or you are a regular act in the club circuit. If anyone outside that circle can claim that he can perfectly and flawlessly break down an EDM song by simply using generic and cliche words commonly associated to it–and not use the true technical terms in reviewing an EDM track–then he is lying through his teeth and misleading the readers to believe that he even knows what he is talking about in the first place. Readers are not stupid, you know, to not know how clueless you are. Because you are not fooling anyone… but yourself. By the way, stop using my articles as your resource paper for your column! Start having your own thoughts and original ideas! Have honor and integrity in your work!</p>

	<p>Because each and every music aficionado, music critic, music intellectual, etc. has his own specific strengths and a scope of things he best specializes in. That is why in every major media outlet there are around at least 5 to 6 people who write about popular music so that all possible areas can be covered. 
	Not one person can possibly write about everything that has to do with popular music without falling short in certain aspects when it comes to specific genres and providing the needed knowledge to go with it.</p>
	
	<p>EDM is purely digital… meaning more often than not there are not any real organic sounding musical instruments used in it besides the occasional sampling of a riff, portions of a drum track, melody, vocals, etc. Almost everything about an EDM track is made for the instant consumption of the masses. Listen to it and then forget it and move on to the next. That is the way it has been for decades. To ignore this reality is to be ignorant of one of the rules in the music industry that has turned it truly into a money making business since Day One. EDM is one of the most dominant genres today to that rule.</p>
	
	<p>Now, this is where The Chainsmokers comes in because their approach is a bit different to a degree when it comes to producing EDM tracks such as this one. Perhaps Alex Pall and Andrew Taggart were aware that they had to make some minor adjustments in their music to reach a much wider audience. I say this because the typical The Chainsmokers track has more identifying nuances in it that separate it from the rest of the EDM out there.</p>
	
	<p>Firstly, the tempo of their tracks is intentionally slowed down considerably… meaning the BPM of the song are dialed down so that the listener can “digest” more the song and process the song in their heads while listening to it, and not be overwhelmed by it. 
	That is one of the two differentiating factors The Chainsmokers have done to make the necessary tweaking to their songs once they made that leap into the mainstream. Secondly, it does help that one half of The Chainsmokers, Andrew Taggart, has a decent singing voice that worked especially well with guest artist, Halsey, in their hit single “Closer.”</p>
	
	<p>What does all this mean? It proves lending a more “organic feel” and a grounded approach to the making of the song can work wonders as the single “Closer” has accomplished for The Chainsmokers. No fixed formula here on the part of Andew Taggart and Alex Pall–they just know what the audience want at the moment and how to give it to them. Yes! They are a key figure of EDM, a genre that some people don’t like. 
	But they also clearly have a connection with their audience. And not a lot of artists can say that.</p>
