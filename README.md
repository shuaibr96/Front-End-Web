These are the wireframes I created before designing my website. creating these wireframes allowed me to visualise what iw as going to do and they also made it easier for me to start creating my website. 

I decided to create a website based around music, as it is something that I am very passionate about. This allows me to use prior knowledge I have on music to create a website. 
It also allowed me to picture my designs in my head before creating wirframes which gave me an edge when it come to creating the website. 

The layout was based on other professional review websites I had seen previously online, but I added decided to add my on touch when it came to the colour shceme. 
I chose to go with a simple dark grey with a light grey as my background, as I believe a simple colour scheme creates a professional looking website. The genres I covered on my website are R&B, House and Grime. These are 
the genres that I like the most and I in my opinion are the genres that are being listened to the most today. 

I encountered several problems while I was designing my website:
- Validation errrors where quite difficult to fix on some of the pages, as it was quite diffuclt to determine what was causing the error.
- Resizing was difficult when it came to determining what size each image had to be to fit the page correctly.
- Sticking to my initial design ideas was difficult getting everything in the right place, position and size like it is on the wireframes.
